Task-01
Text Generation with GPT-2:Train a model to generate coherent
                          and contextually relevant text based
                          on a given prompt. Starting with GPT-
                          2, a transformer model developed by
                          OpenAl, you will learn how to fine-tune
                          the model on a custom dataset to
                          create text that mimics the style and
                          structure of your training data.
Task-02
Image Generation with Pre-trained Models: Utilize pre-trained generative
                                          models like DALL-E-mini or Stable
                                          Diffusion to create images from
                                          text prompts.

Task-03
Text Generation with Markov Chains: Implement a simple text generation
                                    algorithm using Markov chains. This
                                    task involves creating a statistical
                                    model that predicts the probability of
                                    a character or word based on the
                                    previous one(s).

Task-04
Image-to-Image Translation with cGAN: Implement an image-to-image
                                      translation model using a
                                      conditional generative
                                      adversarial network (cGAN)
                                      called pix2pix.

Task-05
Neural Style Transfer : Apply the artistic style of one
                        image (e.g., a famous painting)
                        to the content of another image
                        using neural style transfer.
